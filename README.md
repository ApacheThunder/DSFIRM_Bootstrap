# DSFIRM_Bootstrap
Bootstrap for booting DS Firmware SRL (for DSi/3DS mainly)


This bootstrap program for DS/DSi/3DS that can boot firmware.nds file from SD.
The main purpose this program serves is to allow the currently inserted cart in slot1 to show up in the menu!
Inserted carts can be launched but as of v1.0 all carts currently white screen for unknown reasons.

Further research on how the firmware.nds file expects the cart to be setup is needed for this to fully work.

NDS file for DS/DS Lite users (if you are feeling redundent...:P )
CIA for 3DS users.
title folder for HiyaCFW users on DSi
DSI file for Unlaunch on DSi users.
